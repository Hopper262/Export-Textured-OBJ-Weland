Export Textured OBJ
===================

Export Textured OBJ is a plugin for [Weland](https://www.github.com/treellama/weland), a map editor for [Aleph One](https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone) and the Marathon series of games.

This plugin exports level geometry as a Wavefront OBJ file, similar to the built-in feature, but it also produces an .mtl file and texture references so that fully-textured levels can be loaded and viewed in other programs.

Note that the texture images must be exported in a separate step; see "pkg-readme.txt" for full instructions.
